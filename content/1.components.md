# Components

Think in components. Consider each piece of your UI as an individual "component".

## Naming components

Components will be named with **at least two words**, with a dash between each word. Examples of components:

* A like button (`.like-button`)
* A search form (`.search-form`)
* A news article card (`.article-card`)
* A namespaced component (`.rico-custom-header`)
