# Nested components

```html
<div class='article-link'>
  <div class='vote-box'>
    ...
  </div>
  <h3 class='heading'>...</h3>
  <p class='text'>...</p>
</div>
```

Sometimes it's necessary to nest components. Here are some guidelines for doing that.

## Variants

A component may need to appear a certain way when nested in another component. Avoid modifying the nested component by reaching into it from the containing component.

```css
.article-header {
  > .vote-box > .up { /* âœ— avoid this */ }
}
```

Instead, prefer to add a variant to the nested component and apply it from the containing component.

```html
<div class='article-header'>
  <div class='vote-box -highlight'>
    ...
  </div>
  ...
</div>
```

```css
.vote-box {
  &.-highlight > .up { /* ... */ }
}
```
