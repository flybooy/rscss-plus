# Variants

Components may have variants. Elements may have variants, too.

## Naming variants

Classnames for variants will be prefixed by a dash (`-`).

  ```css
  .like-button {
    &.-wide { /* ... */ }
    &.-short { /* ... */ }
    &.-disabled { /* ... */ }
  }
  ```

## Element variants

Elements may also have variants.

  ```css
  .shopping-card {
    > .title { /* ... */ }
    > .title.-small { /* ... */ }
  }
  ```

## Dash prefixes

A dash is the preferred prefix for a variant because:

* It prevents ambiguity with elements.
* A CSS class name can only start with a letter, `_` or `-`.
* A dash is easier to type than an underscore.
* It kind of resembles switches in UNIX commands (`gcc -O2 -Wall -emit-last`).
